# Whats-for-Dinner-

## Description

What do you want to eat? is one of the toughest questions to answer, yet asked all the time. I present to you, Whats-for-Dinner.

Whats-for-dinner is a questionnair styled website designed to generate a food dish or drink for you. Simply click through a few questions and images and we are narrowed down to two options from plenty, displaying recipe and nutrients. This website is able to help solve the age old question that is being asked everyday. 

Through this project, me and my collaborators were able to learn the agile working environment, git version control and many more technical aspects. 

Mnay challenges were faced while creating this project. Mainly working with api's, and website design.
Api's are new and challenging to work with for our team as it was a very experimental process with choosing a sutible one for our design.
Having an idea is one thing, but putting it out on paper and designing it is another story. With no prior experience in UI/UX design, creating a website that is presentable posed a challenge.

Having said that, much was learnt from this collab project and we are excited to share our website to you!
